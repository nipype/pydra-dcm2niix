# Pydra Dcm2Niix Task

This repository aims to be the canonical set of Pydra tasks for incorporating
A Pydra task interface for the dcm2niix DICOM to NIfTI converter tool (https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix).

Part of this effort is to establish a (mostly) declarative language for describing tasks that
potentially have intricate rules for determining the availability and names from the choice of
inputs.
